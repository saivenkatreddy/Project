              <p>No matter what the circumstances are, eating gluten-free is definitely a learning process. Fortunately, there are tons of amazing gluten-free blogs out there with reviews, recipes, and advice on how to get started. We all know how hard it is when you first go gluten-free.

              <h3>Made with love & Passion</h3>
              <p>Human beings have always eaten, but the business of selling food to customers who order off a menu is a phenomenon dating back to the French Revolution. Before that time, diners bought food at street food stalls and public houses. Today's restaurants are characterized by their capacity to create a space and a dining experience. They also usually offer customers a choice of menu options. Upscale restaurants offering fixed price menus are an exception to this trend, but they nonetheless focus on the dining experience, as compared to the expedient fare of historical eating options.</p>

SO GOOD.
      
      Fresh flavor in every nook and cranny.
      
      I still have a bunch of basil left in my garden that is nearing the end of its life (aka winter is coming), so I am excited to be making a bunch of pesto right now. And the flavor – ugh. It’s so fresh and so good. I was licking the remnants of it right out of the food processor.
